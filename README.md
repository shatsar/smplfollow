Smplfollow
===

It's a simple bot I wrote a couple of years ago to play with Twitter social interactions.

Basic concepts:

* follow every follower you have
* 2 days after your follow, unfollow everyone that is not following you back

It is really simple to configure and use:
provide a configuration file (-c <path_to_configuration_file> )

Moreover, you can add a 'target'. This could be a user similar to you. This software takes a list of his/her followers and follows them.

BTW, I'm pretty sure it *violates* twitter's terms of service.
